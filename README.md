# Power calculation eploration

This repository contains resources and information on performing power calculations for a two-sample t-test. It provides interactive tools to explore the intricate relationships between statistical power, effect size, and significance in such tests.

Included in this repository is a user-friendly R Shiny dashboard app, implemented within a Jupyter notebook, that offers an intuitive and visual understanding of these relationships. For those preferring Python, a simpler yet effective implementation is also provided.

If you do not already have R functionality set up in your Jupyter environment, please refer to the 'Installation of R for a Jupyter Environment' repository for guidance.
