    "This notebook provides an interactive plot which allows for the exploration of sample sizes required for desired significance level, power and effect size in a study. It is a very simple method which basically looks up the sample size needed to achieve a certain power and significance level conditional on the effect size. The goal is to build upon this basic approach to make suitable in the context of metabolic studies."

    "\n",
    "**Power analysis** is a technique so enough samples are taken in a study to identify a significant effect but not too large to be wasteful.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Some key terminology:\n",
    "- The **significance** $(\\alpha)$ of a test is the probability of saying a non-effect exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **power** $(1-\\beta)$ of a test is the probability of saying a effect exists if in fact it exists\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **effect size** is the degree to which a phenomenon exists in a population. \n",
    "\n",
    "Take for example testing an athlete for doping where the number of samples is the number of biomarkers being tested for irregularities. The effect size here is the degree to which one of these biomarkers differs from that of an individual who is completely clean, never doped. The goal is to take enough samples so that we can say with an acceptable degree of confidence the doping status of such an athlete. Ideally we want to take as little samples as possible due to cost constraints etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we set the signifacnce level of a test really low, say 0.001, so that we almost never make the mistake of saying a clean athlete has doped then it is quite likely that we end up in the scenario that we also rearely pick up a doped athlete as doped. ie. low power of the test. (include plots for these)\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, if we set the significance level to some reasonable value and desire extremely high power, say 0.95, then in order to achieve such a power we need to take an unreasonably large sample size. \n",
    "\n",
    "Conventionally the power of a test is taken to be 0.8 (0.2 of the time we do not identify an effect) and significance at 0.05. This does not seem to differ in metabolic studies (Blaise et al. etc.). This implies we assume falsely saying a clean athlete has doped is 4 times worse than saying a doped athlete is clean in the above example. "
